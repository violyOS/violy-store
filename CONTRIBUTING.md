## Runing and building the app
You can run or build violyOS Store by yourself. You can build in Linux, Windows or Mac OS but the software install features will work only in linux systems. 

### Setting up the project
#### Step 1: Installing dependencies
You will need the following tools:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Version: 2.23.0 or above)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (Version: 10.16.3 or above)

Under Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and derivatives the next line will install them:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs git npm
```

#### Step 2: Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/violyOS Store/violyOS Store.git
cd violyOS Store
```

#### Step 3: Installing the project dependecies (npm based)
```
npm install
```
> Warning: do not run the above line as root (e.g. with sudo)

### Running the app

```
npm run start
```

### Building the app
#### To build for linux run:
```
npm run electron:linux
```
This command will create:
- An AppImage file 
- An .deb file
- An .snap file
- A folder `linux-unpacked` folder with the unpacked app


***PPS: You can run/build for Windows or MacOS too. But the installing app features will not work***
